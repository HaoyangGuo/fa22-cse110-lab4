# Part1
1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. Error, because the variable result is out of the scope of the if/else statement at line 20, so it is no longer defined
5. Error, because we are trying to reassigning num1 + num2 to result, but result is declared by the const keyword, which means that it cannot be reassigned
6. Nothing, since an error is threw before line 13 is executed
